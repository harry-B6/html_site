<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Harry and at the time of publishing this site (28th June 2024) I am 29 years old. I am coming to the end of my Professional Certificate in Data Analytics, an Executive Education Programme from Imperial College's Business School. I am currently based (at the time of publishing) in Ellesborough, Buckinghamshire. It's a small village in the countryside, north and outside of London. I studied Chemistry with Biomedicine at university, followed by a Master's by Research degree in Systems and Synthetic Biology. I am interested in working in data science and data analytics in the near future. I am interested in all types of machine learning, and would like to learn more about deep learning. My capstone project is a time series forecasting problem which I am solving using machine learning. Outside of this domain, my hobbies include running when I can, and doing pencil drawing. </p>
